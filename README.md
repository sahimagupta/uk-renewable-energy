## 📖 The Story Behind This Project

The United Kingdom has been at the forefront of the global renewable energy transition. From the windswept coasts of Scotland to the solar farms of southern England, the UK's energy landscape has been transformed over the past 15 years.

This dashboard analyzes **official government data** from the **Department for Energy Security & Net Zero (DESNZ)**, tracking every megawatt of renewable electricity installed and every gigawatt-hour generated across the UK from **2009 to 2024**. The data covers all major renewable sources  wind (onshore and offshore), solar PV, hydropower, bioenergy, and marine energy and breaks down performance across England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland.

The story that emerges is one of **remarkable growth**: the UK has more than quadrupled its renewable electricity generation in just 15 years, driven primarily by the explosive expansion of offshore wind and solar PV.

## 🔍 Key Findings

### 📈 Explosive Growth
- UK renewable generation grew from **~25 TWh in 2009 to over 135 TWh in 2024**  a 5x increase
- Installed capacity expanded from **8 GW to over 60 GW** in the same period
- Renewables now account for over **40% of UK electricity generation**

### 🌊 Wind Dominates
- **Wind energy** (onshore + offshore combined) is the single largest renewable source
- **Offshore wind** has grown from just 1.7 TWh in 2009 to over 45 TWh  a 25x increase
- The UK has one of the world's largest offshore wind fleets, with over 14 GW installed
- Offshore wind load factors consistently exceed 35%, making it highly productive

### ☀️ Solar Surge
- Solar PV capacity grew from a mere **27 MW in 2009 to over 17 GW in 2024**
- Generation increased from 20 GWh to over 15 TWh effectively from zero to a major contributor
- Most growth occurred between 2011-2016 during the feed-in tariff era

### 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿 Scotland Punches Above Its Weight
- Despite having only ~8% of UK population, **Scotland generates ~30% of UK renewable electricity**
- Scotland's energy mix is heavily wind-dominated, with significant hydro contribution
- Wales and Northern Ireland have smaller but growing renewable sectors

### 🔋 Bioenergy's Quiet Contribution
- Plant biomass, landfill gas, and anaerobic digestion collectively generate over 30 TWh
- While less glamorous than wind and solar, bioenergy provides **baseload renewable power** producing electricity regardless of weather conditions

### 📉 Declining Load Factors for Legacy Sources
- Landfill gas load factors have steadily declined from ~58% to ~46% as sites mature
- Offshore wind load factors have improved over time, reflecting better turbine technology

## 🛠️ Technologies & Methods

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **R 4.5+** | Data extraction, cleaning, visualization |
| **readxl** | Parsing complex multi-sheet government Excel files |
| **tidyverse** | Data wrangling (dplyr, tidyr, stringr, forcats) |
| **Plotly** | Interactive charts (area, line, pie, scatter, dual-axis) |
| **DT (DataTables)** | Searchable/filterable/exportable data tables |
| **Quarto** | Reproducible dashboard framework |

## 💡 Policy Insights

1. **Offshore wind is the UK's renewable powerhouse** continued investment in seabed leasing and grid connection is critical
2. **Solar PV growth has plateaued** since the end of feed-in tariffs  new incentive mechanisms may be needed
3. **Scotland's dominance** in renewable generation creates opportunities for green hydrogen production and energy export
4. **Bioenergy provides baseload stability** that variable sources (wind/solar) cannot — its role in grid balancing deserves recognition
5. **Marine energy (wave/tidal)** remains negligible despite the UK's coastline advantage — breakthrough technology needed
